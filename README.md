# CBTCIP_Iris_Flower_Classification

Iris flower has three species; setosa, versicolor, and virginica, which differs according to their measurements. Now assume that you have the measurements of the iris flowers according to their species, and here your task is to train a machine learning model that can learn from the measurements of the iris species and classify them.

We have used top 5 famous Machine Learning Algorithms to check the accuracy for different Algorithms. The Algorithms are:
a) Logistic Regression
b) SVM 
c) KNN 
d) Decision Tree
e) Naive Bayes
